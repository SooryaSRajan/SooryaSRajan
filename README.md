### Hey there, Soorya S heree! ðŸ˜„

I am a CSE undergrad currently doing his fourth year in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. I have a knack for mobile applications and web pages, I also build full-stack stuff and a bit of ML and Cryptography. 

I love developing applications using Android and Flutter.

Feel free to look around, you might stumble upon interesting stuff!
